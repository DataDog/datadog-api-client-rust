# Development

This repository contains code that is autogenerated.

As such, code changes must be made against the templates, not against generated code.

## Testing

### Prerequisite

Export the following environment variables:
* `DD_TEST_CLIENT_API_KEY`: The Datadog API key to run integration tests against
* `DD_TEST_CLIENT_APP_KEY`: The Datadog Application key to run integration tests against

**IMPORTANT**: Do not use production keys.

**NOTE**: All recorded URLs will be replaced by `datadoghq.com`. Please make sure that you do NOT leak any sensitive information.

### Commands

This project contains both Integration and Unit tests.  
__Never__ run the test suite against an organization with production data.

Navigate to the root directory and run   
`cargo test --test main`

Test for a single scenario can be executed via  
`cargo test --test main -- --name "<scenario-name>"`

By default integration tests use recorded API responses stored in cassettes. To record new API responses run the tests with `RECORD=true`.  
To run integration tests against API without recording cassettes, run the tests with `RECORD=none`.
